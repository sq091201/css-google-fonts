            Francois One is a reworking of many traditional sans serif gothic
            display typeface forms. These letterforms have been reshaped for use
            on the web, such as opening up the counters a little and optimizing
            the stems for use in bold display typography. Slanted stem terminals
            have been added to give a hint of playfulness to the design.

            Karla is a grotesque sans serif family designed for the Latin and
            Tamil scripts.This is the Latin part of the family, which has been
            expanded now to a variable font with a weight axis ranging from
            ExtraLight to ExtraBold plus full support of Western, Central, and
            South-Eastern European languages.The rounded shape of the font makes
            it visually comfortable.

            Archivo Black was designed to be used simultaneously in print and
            digital platforms. The technical and aesthetic characteristics of
            the font are both crafted for high performance typography. It was
            designed to be used simultaneously in print and online platforms and
            supports over 200 world languages. Archivo is a grotesque sans serif
            typeface family from Omnibus-Type. It was originally designed for
            highlights and headlines. This family is reminiscent of late
            nineteenth century American typefaces. It includes normal, Black and
            Narrow styles, and was derived from Chivo.The thick stoke of the
            font gives a heavy and reliable feel.

            Hind is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin
            scripts. Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, the
            Hind font family includes five styles. Hind’s letterforms have a
            humanist-style construction, which is paired with seemingly
            monolinear strokes. Most of these strokes have flat endings: they
            either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than
            on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the
            characters. In addition to this, Hind’s letterforms feature open
            apertures. The entire typeface family feels very legible when used
            to set text.

            Vollkorn came into being as the first typeface design by Friedrich
            Althausen. First published in 2005 under a Creative Commons license,
            it was soon downloaded thousands of times and used in all kinds of
            web and print projects. Until the counter finally collapsed two
            years later it had been downloaded thousands of times and used for
            web and print matters. It intends to be a quiet, modest and well
            working text face for bread and butter use. Unlike its examples in
            the book faces from the renaissance until today, it has dark and
            meaty serifs and a bouncing and healthy look. It might be used as
            body type as well as for headlines or titles.
          </p>

            PT Sans was developed for the project "Public Types of Russian
            Federation." The second family of the project, PT Serif, is also
            available. The fonts are released with a libre license and can be
            freely redistributed: The main aim of the project is to give
            possibility to the people of Russia to read and write in their
            native languages. The fonts include standard Western, Central
            European and Cyrillic code pages, plus the characters of every title
            language in the Russian Federation. This makes them a unique and
            very important tool for modern digital communications.
